TIME:: Initializing the iterator (randomizing the list) takes 
O(n) for copying the elements and O(n) for shuffling, which gives you in O(n).
SPACE:: The iterator requires O(n) space to store the randomized elements.

Pros/Cons of the bag ::

Pros:
	random access to elements in a different order each time
	simple structure for use cases where order isn’t important
Cons:
	cannot directly remove elements or access them by index
	limited functionality // compared to more structured data types 
		((like a list or queue
